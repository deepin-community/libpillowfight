Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Breaks: libpillowfight (<< ${binary:Version})
Description: Various image processing algorithms library
 Really simple C Library containing various image processing algorithms.
 It includes the following algorithms:
  - Unpaper's algorithms: Blackfilter, Noisefilter, Blurfilter, Masks,
 Grayfilter, Border
  - Canny edge detection
  - Sobel operator
  - Gaussian blur
  - ACE (Automatic Color Equalization ; Parallelized implementation)
  - SWT (Stroke Width Transformation)
  - Compare : Compare two images (grayscale) and makes the pixels that are
 different really visible (red).
  - Scan borders: Tries to detect the borders of a page in an image coming from
 a scanner.
 .
